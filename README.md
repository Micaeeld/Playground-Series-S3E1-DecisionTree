# Car demand forecast
This notebook features a solution to the "Playground Series - S3E11" challenge available on Kaggle. The objective of this challenge is to create a car demand forecast model based on historical sales data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook contains information about car sales in different regions and time periods. The information includes data such as the average price of the car, sales volume, number of competitors, among others.

## Exploratory data analysis
Initially, I performed an exploratory analysis of the data to understand the distribution of sales and the relationship between the different variables in the dataset. Then, I cleaned the data, treating missing values and selecting the most relevant variables for the model.

## Model training
I used a linear regression model to predict car demand. The model was trained with the training data and validated with the test data.

## Results
The trained model can be used to predict car demand with reasonable accuracy. This type of model can be useful for companies in the automotive sector to better understand the demand for cars in different regions and time periods and to inform business decisions.
